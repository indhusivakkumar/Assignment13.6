1. What kind of data Hbase can store.

 * Hbase is a column-oriented database which can store and manage structured and semi-structured data.
 * The data stored in HBase can be manipulated using Hadoop’s MapReduce capabilities.
 * Data is stored and retrieved in columns so that it can read only relevant data if some data is required.

=======================================================================================================================================================================
2. Explain the important terms in hbase architecture.

HBase architecture consists of 3 important components.They are
 
 HMaster
 Region Server 
 ZooKeeper

HMaster:
 HMaster is a lightweight process that assigns regions to region servers in the Hadoop cluster for load balancing. HMaster has several responsibilities.They are:

 * It Controls the failover
 *It Performs Administration
 *It Manages and Monitors the Hadoop Cluster
 *HMaster handles DDL operations
 *Whenever a client wants to change the schema and change any of the metadata operations, HMaster is responsible for all these operations.

Region Server:
 *Region Servers  are the worker nodes which handle read, write, update, and delete requests from clients. 
 *Region Server process runs on every node in the hadoop cluster.
 *It runs on HDFS DataNode 
 *It consists of the following components –

Block Cache : Block cache is a read cache in which most frequently read data is stored  and whenever the block cache is full, recently used data is evicted.
MemStore: MemStore is the write cache in which new data that is not yet written to the disk is stored. All the column families in a region has a MemStore.
Write Ahead Log (WAL):WAL is a file in which new data that is not persisted to permanent storage is stored.
HFile:It is the actual storage file that stores the rows as sorted key values on a disk.

ZooKeeper
* ZooKeeper is a distributed coordination service for region assignments and to recover any region server crashes by loading them onto other region servers
  which are functioning. 
* It has ephemeral nodes representing different region servers. Master servers use these nodes to discover available servers.
* The nodes are also used to track server failures or network partitions.
* Clients communicate with region servers via zookeeper.
* It is a centralized monitoring server which maintains configuration information and  used to provide distributed synchronization.

Uses:
*Establishing client communication with region servers.
*Tracking server failure and network partitions.
*Maintain Configuration Information

3. What is zookeeper? What happens if the zookeeper service is stopped.

ZooKeeper
* ZooKeeper is a distributed coordination service for region assignments and to recover any region server crashes by loading them onto other region servers

* The nodes are also used to track server failures or network partitions.
* Clients communicate with region servers via zookeeper.

What happens if the zookeeper service is stopped.
If you have more than one Zookeeper(ZK) node then if  ZK node that went down then the CLDB will get a disconnect exception from it and shut itself down.
 The warden process running on the same machine should've restarted the CLDB within a minute, and the CLDB would reconnect to the new ZK master.

4. Is it necessary that region server be located on all DataNodes?

No it is not necessary that region server be located on all DataNodes but it is recommended that you install HBase RegionServers on each datanode since
RegionServers can benefit from "short-circuit" reads which can only happen when the RegionServer is co-located with the Datanode.

=======================================================================================================================================================================
5. How will you implement joins in Hbase?

There are some ways to  implement joins in Hbase.They are:
* Load data in HIVE and design hive queries to perform joins in HBase
* Develop map reduce application to perform join.
* Load the HBase tables into Impala and perform a SQL join with those tools.
